# Krishna Paudel — Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive personal website that highlights my background, projects, and tools I built for the City of Delta. The site is designed for clarity, speed, and a polished experience on desktop and mobile.

## ✨ Highlights
- Clean, high‑contrast UI with animated tech background and smooth interactions
- Fully responsive layout with thoughtful mobile tweaks
- Clear navigation to About, Projects, City of Delta tools, and Contact
- Fast, static delivery (no backend required for browsing)
- Working contact form powered by EmailJS

## 🗺️ Pages
- `index.html` — Home/About
  - Education, work experience, certificates, and skills
  - Social links and resume download
- `projects.html` — Project summaries and links to demo pages
- Tools (demo UIs):
  - `meter-form-processor.html`
  - `single-occupancy-discount.html`
  - `secondary-suite-exemption.html`
  - `water-consumption-anomaly.html`
  - `sql-query-generator.html` (UI only; shows Access Denied in static mode)
- `contact.html` — Contact form (EmailJS) with copy‑email utility

## 🧩 How to Use
- Navigate via the top bar to sections and pages
- Use Projects to jump to specific tool demos
- Contact page supports sending a message via EmailJS, or copying the email address directly

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
